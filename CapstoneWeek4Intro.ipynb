    "This notebook is part of the Capstone Project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate. For this project, I will be exploring a hypothetical request regarding Japanese restaurants in New York City. As of 2011, about 20,000 Japanese were living in New York City and a total of around 45,000 Japanese were living in the Greater New York City area. Most of this population consists of students, artists and expatriate business workers who are typically posted within the US for three to five years. While the Japanese in New York comprise a smaller demographic than the Chinese or Korean populations respectively, the popularity of Japanese cuisine means that there will never be a lack of demand, both from the largest Japanese community on the East Coast and from the general public, tourists and locals alike."
